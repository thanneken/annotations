		<verse number="11">So Abram went to Egypt in the third year of the week. He lived in the land of Egypt for five years before his wife was taken from him by force. </verse>
		<verse number="12">Tanais, the Egyptian city, was built at that time — seven years after Hebron. </verse>
		<verse number="13">When the pharaoh took Abram's wife Sarah by force, the Lord punished the pharaoh and his household very severely because of Abram's wife Sarah. </verse>
		<verse number="14">At that time he made Abram extremely wealthy with all (kinds of) sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, horses, male and female servants, silver and very (much) gold. Lot — his brother's son — was also wealthy. </verse>
		<verse number="15">The pharaoh returned Abram's wife Sarah to her husband and expelled him from the land of Egypt. He went to the place where he had first pitched his tent — at the location of the altar, with Ai on the east side and Bethel on the west. He blessed the Lord his God who had brought him back safely.</verse>

		<verse number="19">Lot was taken captive from him. But in the fourth year of this week — of the same jubilee — God said to Abram: 'Look up from where you are staying toward the west, the south, the east, and the north; </verse>

		<verse number="23">Abraham did as God told him. He took his son Ishmael, all the men of his household, and those who had been purchased — every male, therefore, in his house; he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins at that time. </verse>
		<verse number="24">On that day Abraham circumcised himself, the men of his household, his domestic servants, and also those who had been purchased from foreigners — he circumcised all.</verse>
		<verse number="25">This law is (valid) for all the history of eternity. There is no omitting any day of the days for which an eternal ordinance has been commanded and written on the heavenly tablets. </verse>

		<verse number="26">Anyone who is born, the flesh of whose private parts has not been circumcised by the eighth day, does not belong to the <pagestart p19c="051" p5c="094"/> pact which God made for Abraham but to the people (meant for) destruction. Moreover, there is no sign on him that he belongs to God, but (he is meant) for destruction and for being destroyed from the earth, because he has violated the covenant of the Lord our God. </verse>
		<verse number="27">For all the angels of the presence and all the archangels of blessing were from the days of their creation. In front of the angels of the presence and the angels of sanctification he sanctified Israel to be together with him and the angels of his holy places.</verse>

		<verse number="30">For God did not draw near to himself either Ishmael, his sons, his brothers, or Esau. He did not choose any of them (simply) because they, too, were among Abraham's children, since he knew them. But he chose Israel to be his people. </verse>

		<verse number="6">For God will execute judgment in the same way in the places where people have acted in the abominable ways of Sodom — in the same manner he will judge them. </verse>
		<verse number="7">But we rescued Lot afterwards because God remembered Abraham so that he might deliver [read deliberaret; Ronsch, 102] him from the overthrow (of Sodom). </verse>
		<verse number="8">Now he and his daughters [text reads sons] committed a sin on the earth the like of which was not committed on the entire earth from the time of Abraham [error for Adam] until him in that the man lay with his daughters. </verse>
		<verse number="9">For it has now been commanded and written on the heavenly tablets with regard to all (his) descendants that such (people) will be removed and uprooted and that their judgment will be like the judgment of Sodom so that there may not be left among them any human descendants on the earth on the day of judgment.</verse>

		<verse number="10">During this month Abraham departed from Hebron. He went and settled between Kadesh and Sur in the boundaries of Gerar. </verse>
		<verse number="11">In the middle of the <pagestart p19c="055" p5c="098"/> fifth month he removed himself from there and settled at the well of the oath. </verse>
		<verse number="12">In the middle of the sixth month God visited Sarah and did for her as he had said. </verse>
		<verse number="13">She became pregnant and gave birth to a son in the seventh month; in the middle of the month, at the time that God had told Abraham — on the festival of the firstfruits — Isaac was born. </verse>
		<verse number="14">Abraham circumcised his son on the eighth day. He was the first to be circumcised according to the covenant which was ordained forever.</verse>

	<paragraph>
		<verse number="15">In the sixth year of the fourth week we came to Abraham at the well of the oath. We appeared to him just as we had said to Sarah that we would return to her and she would have become pregnant with her son. </verse>
		<verse number="16">We returned during the seventh month, and in front of us we found Sarah pregnant. We blessed him and and told him what had been decreed for him and in what way he would die, that he would become the father of six more sons, and that he would see them all before he died; but (that) through Isaac he would <pagestart p19c="054" p5c="099"/> become numerous and have a reputation.</verse>
		<verse number="17">All the descendants of his sons would become nations and be numbered with the nations. But one of Isaac's sons would become a holy progeny which would not be numbered with the nations; </verse>
		<verse number="18">for he would become the share of the Most High, since all his descendants had fallen into that which God posseses; that they would become God's people sanctified out of all his nations; and that they would become a priestly kingdom and a holy people. </verse>
		<verse number="19">Then we went on our way and told Sarah what we had reported to him. The two of them were extremely happy.</verse>

		<verse number="20">There he built an altar for the Lord who had rescued him, and of his grace [corrupt, see Ronsch, 103] (was) in the country where he resided as an alien. He celebrated a joyful festival in this month — for seven days — near the altar. </verse>
		<verse number="21">He constructed tents for himself and his servants during this festival. He was the first to celebrate the festival of tabernacles on the earth. </verse>
		<verse number="22">During the days he was making — throughout each of the days — an offering [cf. Ronsch, 103-104] to the Lord on the altar: two bull calves, two rams, seven sheep, one goat for sins in order to <pagestart p19c="053" p5c="100"/> have atonement made through it for himself and his descendants. </verse>
		<verse number="23">And as a peace offering: seven rams, seven kids, seven sheep, seven he-goats as well as their (cereal)-offerings and their libations; and he would burn all their fat on the altar ... offering for a pleasing fragrance. </verse>
		<verse number="24">In the morning and evening he would burn as a composite incense-offering [cf. Ronsch, 104]: frankincense, galbanum, stacte, nard, myrrh, aromatic spices, and costum. These seven clean kinds he would burn beaten and equally mixed. </verse>
		<verse number="25">He celebrated this festival for seven days, being happy [cf. Ronsch, 105] with his whole heart and all his being — he and all those who belonged to his household. There was no foreigner with them; everyone was circumcised. </verse>
		<verse number="26">He blessed his creator who had created him for he knew and ascertained that from him there would come a true plant for the history of eternity and (that) from him there would be holy descendants so that they should be like the one who had created everything. </verse>
		<verse number="27">He gave a blessing and was very happy. <pagestart p19c="049" p5c="101"/> He named this festival the festival of the days — a joy acceptable to the most high God. </verse>
		<verse number="28">We blessed him eternally and all his descendants with him throughout all the history of the entire earth because he had celebrated this festival at its time in accord with the testimony of the heavenly tablets. </verse>
		<verse number="29">For this reason it has been ordained on the heavenly tablets regarding Israel that the festival of tabernacles should be (celebrated) completely (?) with joy for seven days in the seventh month, acceptable in the Lord's presence — a law which is eternal throughout their history in every year. </verse>
		<verse number="30">There will be no temporal limit because it is ordained forever that Israel should celebrate it, live in tents, and to place wreaths on their heads, to take thick branches and willow branch(es) from the stream.</verse>
		<verse number="31">So Abraham took some palm branches [cf. Charles, 1895, reading de corde for de decore] and the fruit of good trees, and during all the days he would go around my altar with branches seven times. In the morning he would give praise and and joyfully laud [cf. Ronsch, 106] his <pagestart p19c="050" p5c="102"/> God for all things.</verse>

		<verse number="1">In the first year of the fifth week, in this jubilee, Isaac was weaned. Abraham gave a large banquet, and in the third month, on the day when his son Isaac was weaned. </verse>
		<verse number="2">Now Ishmael, the son of Hagar the Egyptian servant girl, was in the place in front of his father Abraham. Abraham was very happy and blessed God because he saw his own sons and had not died childless. </verse>
		<verse number="3">He remembered the message which he had told him on the day when Lot had separated from him. He was very happy because God had given him descendants on the earth to possess it. With his full voice he blessed (the one) who created everything.</verse>

		<verse number="4">When Sarah saw Ishmael playing with Isaac and Abraham being extremely happy, she became jealous of Ishmael. She said to Abraham: 'Banish this servant girl and her son because the son of this servant girl will not be an heir with my son Isaac'. </verse>

		<verse number="1">During the year of the first week in the forty-second jubilee, Abraham returned and lived opposite Hebron,*that is, Kiriath Arba, for two weeks of years. </verse>
		<verse number="2">In the year of this third week of this jubilee, <pagestart p19c="059" p5c="109"/> the days of Sarah's life were completed and she died in Hebron. </verse>
		<verse number="3">When Abraham went to mourn for her, we tested whether he himself was patient and not faint-hearted in the words that he spoke. But in this respect he was found most patient and not disturbed, </verse>
		<verse number="4">because he spoke with the Hittites in a patient spirit so that they would give him a place in which to bury his dead. </verse>
		<verse number="5">God gave him a favorable reception before all who would see him. He mildly pleaded with the Hittites, and they gave him the double land of the cave which is opposite Mamre — that is, Hebron — for 400 silver pieces. </verse>
		<verse number="6">They requested this from him: 'Allow us to give (it) to you for nothing'! Yet he did not take (it) from them for nothing but he gave as the price of the place the full amount of money. He bowed twice to them and afterwards buried his dead in the double cave. </verse>
		<verse number="7">All the time of Sarah's life was 127 years — that is, two jubilees, <pagestart p19c="060" p5c="110"/> four weeks less one year. This was the time of Sarah's life.</verse>

		<verse number="10">In its fourth year Abraham took a wife for his son Isaac. Her name was Rebecca, the daughter of Bethuel (the son of Abraham's brother Nahor), the sister of Laban, the daughter of Bethuel. Bethuel was the son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor. </verse>
		<verse number="11">Abraham married a third wife whose name was Keturah — one of the daughters of his household servants — because Hagar died prior to Sarah. </verse>

	<paragraph>
		<verse number="13">In the sixth week, during its <pagestart p19c="058" p5c="111"/> second year, Rebecca gave birth to two sons for Isaac: Esau and Jacob. Jacob was gentle and upright, while Esau was harsh and a rustic, hairy man. Jacob used to live in tents. </verse>
		<verse number="14">When they both grew up and became young men, Jacob learned (the art of) writing, but Esau did not learn (it) because he was a rustic man and a hunter. But he learned (the art of) warfare, and all the things that he did were harsh. </verse>

		<verse number="16">As Abraham observed Esau's behavior, he realized that through Jacob he would have posterity and a reputation. He summoned Rebecca and gave her orders about Jacob, since she loved Jacob more than Esau. </verse>

		<verse number="9">For the times of the ancients were as many as nineteen jubilees for (their) lives. After the flood the times of these jubilees began to decrease, to grow old more quickly, and the times of their lives to decrease because of the numerous difficulties and being wicked in their ways — with the exception of Abram. </verse>
		<verse number="10">For Abraham was perfect with God in everything he did — being truly pleasing throughout all his lifetime. And yet (even) he had not completed four jubilees during his lifetime when he became old — because of the evil ones — and reached the end of his time. </verse>

		<verse number="16">During that generation the children will find fault with their fathers and <pagestart p19c="124" p5c="133"/> elders because of sin and injustice and because of what they say and the great evils that they commit, because they abandon the covenant which God made between himself and them to observe and perform all his commandments, ordinances, and all his laws.
